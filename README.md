# BlackJack

[This](https://mkbailey391.github.io/BlackJack/) is a link to my game.




Blackjack, also known as twenty-one, is a card game where players compete against the dealer to get as close to a score of 21 as possible.  
The objective of the game is to beat the dealer in one of the following ways:

Get 21 points on the player's first two cards, called Blackjack, without a dealer getting blackjack, reach a final score higher 
than the dealer without exceeding 21, or let the dealer draw additional cards until their hand exceeds 21.
